I would     like to read line-by-line and store each word into different variables. For example: When I read first line "1 1111 47" I would like store the first word "1" into var_1, "1111" into var_2, and "47" into var_3. Then, when it goes to next line, the values should be stored into same var_1, var_2 and var_3 variables respectively.
second new line.
third new line.
